# Roadmap

## v0.1 — "it moves in Unity"

- [x] Metal canvas PoC: Pencil input, pressure, one brush, acceptable latency (~9 ms on iPad Pro 11)
- [x] Layers per frame with opacity/visibility
- [x] Frame strip: add / duplicate / delete / reorder / hold
- [x] Onion skin (configurable before/after)
- [x] Clips (idle, run…) with pivot
- [x] Loop playback
- [x] `.calco` save/load (see `format.md`)
- [x] Export sprite sheet PNG + Aseprite JSON
- [x] Export GIF (current clip)
- [x] `calco-unity` importer: JSON → Sprites + AnimationClips + AnimatorController (`calco-unity/`, verified with Unity 6000.6 in batch mode)

## v0.2 — "usable"

The v0.1 UI grew one control per feature. This pass makes it a tool you can work in.

- [x] Frame strip: drag to reorder (long-press a thumbnail; arrows stay for single steps)
- [x] Layers panel: add / delete / rename / drag to reorder / opacity / visibility / lock, all undoable
- [x] Tool panel: brush / eraser with their own sizes (1–64 px), 16-colour palette + system picker; B, E, [ and ] on a keyboard
- [x] Gestures: two-finger tap undo, three-finger redo, pinch zoom / pan / rotate (fingers only; Pencil always draws; ⌘0 or the fit button resets the view)
- [x] Undo / redo stack (50 steps; strokes, clear, frames, clips, layer visibility, clip settings; ⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for hardware keyboards
- [ ] Consistent iconography and layout pass (portrait and landscape)

## Later

- Pixel-art mode
- Custom brushes
- iCloud sync
- Audio scrubbing
- iPhone

## Never (on purpose)

- Camera, tweening, vectors, rigging. That's a different product.
